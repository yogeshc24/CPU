# Project 3 README


## Project Status
Cpu works for R-type instructions
Adder is working properly
ALU is implemented using the adder and working
Registers store the values properly
Immediate sign bit is generated correctly
Decoder generaters all the output correctly
For flags8 If a bit in WM is set to 1, the corresponding flag in the register will be updated with the value from NF
## Known Issues
Cpu still needs works with I-type, B-type, S-type and U-type instructions.
